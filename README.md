# Tossukissa

Tossukissa is a simple Discord Image bot, that I made to send embedded cat pictures to me and my friends in our discord server.

The bot is free to be forked and edited, or if you want to invite the current working version of the bot to your server, you can click [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1207242151537410058)

In the near future, I am planning on adding a starboard functionality to the bot that displays the most "loved" cats and dogs on the server.
